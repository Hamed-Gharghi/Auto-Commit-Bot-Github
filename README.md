## Overview

**Auto-Commit Bot** is an advanced Python script designed for automating the process of generating, committing, and pushing Python scripts to a GitHub repository. This bot is perfect for developers and teams who need to ensure regular updates and commit changes without manual intervention. Schedule it to run periodically (e.g., every 24 hours) and let it handle the repetitive tasks of file creation and git operations.

### Key Features

- **Automated File Generation**: Create Python scripts with an autogenerated comment header that includes author information, date, and script description.
- **Seamless Git Operations**: Automates the entire process of adding, committing, and pushing changes to your GitHub repository.
- **Scheduled Execution**: Leverage a sleep timer to run the bot at specified intervals, ensuring your repository remains up-to-date with minimal effort.
